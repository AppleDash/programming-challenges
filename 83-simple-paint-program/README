Programming challenge #83: Simple paint program
Written in C#

This is a GUI program for Windows, so it isn't so simple to use.
Run SimplePaint/bin/Debug/SimplePaint.exe directly on Windows, or with mono on Linux.
If you don't trust me, compile it yourself using Visual Studio and then do the same.
It should be self-explanatory from there.
